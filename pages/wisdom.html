        <p class="summary">Today we learn what is required to posess the Triforce of Wisdom. While some may say this is the least appealing of the three, that is not
            the case. This task will take you on a wild ride, and it will not be easy. While you won't be slaying mosnters necessary, you must use stealth and
            guile to ensure the Hero of Time can complete his mission.
